Light-weight, printable microdrive
----------------------------------
Design files for a complete system with drive, shuttle carrier, chamber and holder.
Design is modular, so it can be easily modified to fit diverse sizes, probes and connectors.

Drive:
------
The drive consists of a chamber and a shuttle, enhebrated by a screw, fastened on the lower end by a nut.
The nut should be glued (superglue), so that the turning of the screw drives the shuttle up and down.
The length of the screw and the pitch will define the length and the step of the shuttle run.

The package of files includes two assemblies for the Drive, already designed for two lenghts.
The shuttle also has a carrier that fits the Neuronexus 32 site chronic probes with flex cable.

- derived_drive_assembly_10_1_nn32.iam: parts for a drive based on a 1.0mm x 10mm UNM bolt, and a 1.0mm hex nut.

- derived_drive_assembly_6_06_nn32.iam: parts for a drive based on a 0.6mm x 6mm UNM boltd, and a 0.6mm hex nut.


Chamber:
--------
- chamber_with_holder.iam: electrode chamber that fits the 1 mm drive, flex cable and connector for the neuronexus H16/H32 packages 
(omnetics).



Holder:
-------
holder_to_grab.iam: holder to fasten the drive and the connector while implanting.
