Software (coming soon) and hardware towards a neurally driven vocal prosthesis for songbirds.

For a heterogeneously documented and polished set of repositories with audio stimulation/recording system, data pipelines to go from neural recordings (intan) to spikes (klusta/kilosort), data analysis and decoders based on neural networks and a biophysical model of the vocal organ, take a look at https://github.com/zekearneodo.
